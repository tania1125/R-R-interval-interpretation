# R-R-interval-interpretation
ECG signal processing ,basically focused on R-R interval.

This tool essentially guides you through the interpretation of the ECG database.
Here are the fundamentals for determining the R-R interval and Â its variations.
By doing so, we can recognise numerous ECG signal anomalies.
This is absolutely a beginner friendly program , any one can easily understand it by just digging into it.

This program is coded using python and used module matplotlib to plot the wave.
I recommend to use this code in spyder ide.

In this repository I have also attached with the ECG database that I used ,please do take a look into that too.
